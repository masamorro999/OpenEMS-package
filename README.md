openEMS is a free and open electromagnetic field solver using the FDTD method. Matlab or Octave are used as an easy and flexible scripting interface.

To use openems go to the directory where the binary openEMS is and the run ./openEMS, The output shoud be somthing like:

[...]

Remember, for a proper use of OpenEMS you need Octave/Matlab and then setup the correct path adding the openEMS path to matlab (store the commands in "startup.m" or ".octaverc" in your home directory to load them on startup in matlab or octave respectively).

Thanks and good luck.
